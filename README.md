Arduino nano 33 ble sense can be used to recognize gesture using machine learning. A tensorflow model is designed, built and trained using inertia sensors data on goole colaboratory. Later converted to tensorflow-lite as hardware header file. The sensors include accelerometer sensor, gyroscope and magnetometer
